# Portfolio
This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and building a decision tree model on a dataset sourced from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses/data]. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and predict outcomes based on the data.

The EDA process involved:
Visualizing distributions and relationships between variables

Decision Tree Model:
Splitting the data into training and testing sets
Training the model using the DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn
Tuning parameters to optimize performance

Results
The model achieved the following results:
Accuracy: 96.52%
AUC: 0.51
